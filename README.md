# Database-connectivity--MySQL
Database, a collection of individual data items in a structured manner which can be stored in a single location or can be distributed across large networks.

Application for creating and managing Database, DBMS {Data Base Mnanagement System } is introduced.
RDBMS {Relational Data Base Mnanagement System } is a sub Division of DBMS.

RDBMS is needed due to following reasons (Over the MS Excel and Spredsheets) :-
1. Incomplete data in Spreadsheets.
2. Redundant Data which can't be modified in MS Excel.
3. Heavy File sizes (Which is generally faced for earlier methods of Storage).
4. Security Issues (The most Prominent one).

Here, the DML [ Data Manupulation Language ] and DDL [ Data Defination Language ] both are explained in the given file.
DML as in CREATE , DROP , TURNCATE , ALTER commands.
DDL as in INSERT , SELECT , DELETE , UPDATE commands.
